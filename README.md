# Colada. Collections Framework for PHP [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alexeyshockov/colada.png)](http://travis-ci.org/alexeyshockov/colada)

## Goal

_Convenient_ and _safe_ way to work with collections.

## Benefits

* Functional idioms:
    * immutable collections (safest and usable for most cases),
    * lazy operations â€” don't skimp on it.
* Optional values (to solve NPE problem). Thanks to [schmittjoh/php-option](https://github.com/schmittjoh/php-option).
* Rich maps (with object keys).

## Installation

Colada currently may be installed through [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer):

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "alexeyshockov/colada": "3.0.x-dev"
    }
}
```
